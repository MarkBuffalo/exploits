# Exploits
Contains potentially useful exploits. Not the author unless otherwise stated. Also not responsible for misuse. This is a very early repository lacking a lot of things. Need to vet stuff before uploading. 

# Samba 
- Samba 3.0.24 Directory Traversal Vulnerability.

# Other
- Some libssh exploit I wrote the other day. I think they called it CVE-2018-10933.

# Chrome
- Helps steal credentials across subdomains in Chrome 57+. Think *.azurewebsites.net, *.amazonaws.com, *.wpengine.com, etc. Chrome is the only browser that does this wrong at this present.
